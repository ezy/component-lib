# Custom theming for NZGovt Design System

This is a light-weight POC with the aim of producing a govt front-end component library using storybook, built on top of the [NZGovt Design System (Alpha)](https://github.com/GOVTNZ/govtnz-design-system).

It borrows extensively from the build system in govtnz-ds to: 

* Generate templates from the NZGovt html and css output components
* Overide templates with any custom elements
* Generate a storybook component library from the merged template files
